Blockchain eVault System for Legal Records
Overview
This GitHub repository hosts the Blockchain eVault System for Legal Records project, aiming to revolutionize legal record management using blockchain technology. The project stack includes:

Smart Contract: Solidity (Authentication and Authorization)
Frontend: React (DOM manipulation) with ChakraUI (Boilerplate design)
Backend: Node.js with Express (Web Server)
Blockchain Interaction: Web3.js
Approach Details
The existing legal record management system is not efficient in court proceedings and the sharing, managing and checking integrity of physical paper works makes the case proceedings slower. the existing system is not able to integrate with the other online databases. we need a secure, transparent and user-freindly system to overcome this issue. To address these challenges, we propose:

Existing Problems
Lack of Transparency
No long term data storage
Server Downtimes
Improper authorization system
Simple login and accessing
Less complex sharing system
Improved Solution
Dispute Resolution: Establish a transparent platform for sharing evidence and documents between parties.

Authorization: Implement role-based permissions and access controls for users.

Third Party Integration: Provide easy API access with comprehensive documentation for seamless integration.

Document Sharing: Enable effortless document sharing between parties using an entity-based system.

Fast Court Proceedings: Offer a user-friendly system with efficient role management and verification for lawyers, judges, and other users.

KYC as a Service: Utilize existing databases for user authentication and provide a secure service for legal document verification without exposing user data.
